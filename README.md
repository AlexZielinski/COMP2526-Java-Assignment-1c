Comp 2526 Assignment #1c

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: 

You are to develop a program that prints out the multiplication or addition or Subtraction 
table given the users start and end range and type of table. This time you are required to 
take advantage of Inheritance to improve upon the design. See Assignments #1a and #1b for 
further details.

The base class or super class should be called “Table” and contain all common data members 
and methods found in the classes that will extend it.

Each subclass that extends Table class should be modified to reflect the new OOP design.

You will need to adjust your enumerated type (separate file) for the table types.
